 # Countdown
 countsdown to a date of your choice.

  # Installation 		

  make sure you have the latest version of [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)		

  apart from making sure you have the latest version of PHP their is no setup, just copy the files to where you want them, **just make sure not to change any file names, or move them around**		
  
  if you wish to get a release, go to the releases tab, then download the release.zip file, then unzip and extract the code folder, this contains eerything you need., if you wish to get the latest test version, clone the repository, then move the code folder to your desired location.

  # Before updating		

  make sure to delete the old install, as we sometimes remove files, this will mean that you dont have any wasted space, then just drag the contents of the code file into where you want it.

  # Bugs		

  if you experience any bugs, please report them in the [issues section](https://github.com/Redo-From-Start/countdown/issues), however if the issue you are experiency is already listed their, please just comment on that adding how it affected you.		

  # Usage		

  you can use this software however you want, however I simply want to request that you dont just install this system for anyone to use, the same way it is on my [site](https://www.redofromstart.co.uk/code/custom-count) instead I request that if you want to use this you keep the generation script private, and use the timer script on a page to count down to something of your choice, possibly using an iframe.
