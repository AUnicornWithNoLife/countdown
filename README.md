  make sure you have the latest version of [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)		

  apart from making sure you have PHP their is no setup, just copy the files to where you want them, **just make sure not to change any file names, or move them around**		

  # Before updating		

  make sure to delete the old install, as we sometimes remove files, this will mean that you dont have any wasted space

  # Usage		

  you can use this software howevere you want, howevere i simply want to request that you dont just install this system foir anyone to use, the same way it is on my [site](https://www.redofromstart.co.uk/code/custom-count) instead i request that if youi want to use this you keep the generation script private, and use the timer script on a page to count down to something of your choice.
